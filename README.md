# SerialCraft Minecraft Mod

The SerialCraft mod adds the ability to interface with Minecraft over a serial port. Messages can be 
sent to Minecraft from a device such as an Arduino to control your character, trigger redstone signals,
send chat messages and more. Messages are also sent from Minecraft to your device, such as health or
hunger level changes, redstone signals, nearest creeper distance and more. See the [SerialCraft Arduino
library](https://github.com/AllwineDesigns/serialcraft-arduino) for more information about programming
an Arduino to communicate with the SerialCraft mod.
